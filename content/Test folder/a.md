title : 'What do I want in my Blog?'

#

##### Hey, my name is Thomas.

At the moment, this blog is in a testing fase. However, I want to use that as an opportunity to learn how to create content with Hugo and Mainroad. Ideally, I have some form of content bar at the top (not sure if thats the correct term) for showing of the main categories of content. This would including **Travel stories**, **About me**, **Australia WHV**, **Spanish learning**, and more! Of course, I want to include photos, especially with stories and my experience from travelling.
